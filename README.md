This is for testing Unity project with Google Firebase

In order to run this project, you need: 
1. Credential files in Assets/StreamingAssets. If you don't have the credential files I send to you, make your own through (Adding Firebase to Unity Tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6du3DUTIPI&ab_channel=Firebase] 
2. Unity Firebase SDK. (Download here)[https://firebase.google.com/download/unity] and extract the zip file.

Once you have everything ready, import the package by going to Assets > Import Package > Custom Package... 
Choose FirebaseInstallations, and whatever other features you want to use (FirebaseAnalytics, FirebaseFirestore) 

(This build works for Android, but wasn't tested on different platform)
