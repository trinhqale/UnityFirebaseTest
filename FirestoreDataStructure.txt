                  - Field: Level number (integer)
                  - Field: Level Complete? (boolean)
                  - Field: TinkerMachinesUsed (String : integer) --> comment: Like a table in excel, for example {"Ramp" : 3} means user used the ramp 3 times
                  - Field: ToolsAvailable (String : integer) --> comment: same like above, but this tracks the available tools in this level 
                  - Field: Records (integer : List(time_each_playback) ) 
                                    --> comment: example [[-5.0, -2.5, +3.5], [+4.2] ]
                                    --> user hit playback 5s and fail, then build for 2.5s and fail, then succeed after 3.5s (playback 3 times) 
                                    --> second attempt, they only need 4.2 seconds first try
                                    --> My idea is to use negative number for failed attempts, and positive for completing the level
                        // outer array represents attempts before 
                  - Field: Playback_count --> comment: number of playbacks in this level
                  - Field: Play_again_after_success (integer) --> comment: how many time user replay the level after completing it
